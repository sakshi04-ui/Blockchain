# 🦀 Rust Learning Journey

This repository tracks **all my resources and daily notes** while learning Rust—especially from the **Nexus batch lectures**—along with any extra material I explore.

## 📚 Resources

### Primary

* **Nexus Batch Lectures** 
* [The Rust Programming Language (Rust Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) – Official book, a must-read.
* [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) – Small exercises to practice Rust concepts.

### Additional References

* [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
* [Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) – For build system and package manager.
* Can check rust roadmap on roadmaps.sh for more understanding about topics that need to be learnt

## 🏁 Goal

To build a **solid foundation in Rust**, reinforced by **structured lecture notes**, hands-on exercises, and side projects—ready for real-world backend and systems programming.
